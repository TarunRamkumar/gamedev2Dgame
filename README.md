### Physical Game Idea: KINGDOM COME (name is work in progress)
Up to four players. Each Player gets the King, Queen, and Jack of the same suit so that each player can be reffered to by their suit.
The rest of the cards are distributed to the players and can be used in attack or defense.
- Hearts = Health
- Diamonds = Shield
- Clubs = Ranged Attack (Blocked by shield)
- Spades = Melee Attack

Players all get to apply one of their cards of each suit to their King, Queen, Jack. The rank of each card correlates to how much the value of that suit increases (9 of Hearts increases HP by 9). Need to come up with a scheme for how the gameplay goes and a strategy guide.

**Optional:**

- Maybe don't start with all the cards and have players draw a card at the start of their turns.
- Create the Aces of each suit to be powerups that work uniquely for their suit (or have them like draw an extra card for the Ace of Spades etc.)
- Maybe start each character for each Player (King, Queen, Jack) with some amount of HP so that they don't get instakilled at beginning of game if no hearts are drawn.

### 2D Game Idea: WORKER'S COMP
Platformer on a construction site. Start with the player getting injured by an extraterestrial object and getting superpowers of agility. The main villain is the jobsite boss who is trying to prevent the player from getting off the jobsite to complete a worker's compensation claim and bankrupting the construction company. Other workers try to stop the player because they would be out of a job if he succeeds. Player gets access to tools that are typically found on a jobsite (hammer, skilsaw, nailgun etc.). From the contact with the super secret government goop the player slowly unlocks the ability to slide, doublejump, and i-frame dash. I imagine the boss to look like a pixelated Kingpin from Spiderman universe. I think it would be cool to have the game be lighthearted throughout the gameplay and the final cutscene show the boss having his life fall apart because his company went bankrupt with our actions and all of our coworkers walking off the jobsite with the hithikers sack (red bandana on a stick) so the player realizes that they were the bad guy all along.
