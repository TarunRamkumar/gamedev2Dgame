### 2D Game Idea: WORKER'S COMP
Platformer on a construction site. Start with the player getting injured by an extraterestrial object and getting superpowers of agility. The main villain is the jobsite boss who is trying to prevent the player from getting off the jobsite to complete a worker's compensation claim and bankrupting the construction company. Other workers try to stop the player because they would be out of a job if he succeeds. Player gets access to tools that are typically found on a jobsite (hammer, skilsaw, nailgun etc.). From the contact with the super secret government goop the player slowly unlocks the ability to slide, doublejump, and i-frame dash. I imagine the boss to look like a pixelated Kingpin from Spiderman universe. I think it would be cool to have the game be lighthearted throughout the gameplay and the final cutscene show the boss having his life fall apart because his company went bankrupt with our actions and all of our coworkers walking off the jobsite with the hithikers sack (red bandana on a stick) so the player realizes that they were the bad guy all along. 

- Convinience Store acts as shop and have roller dogs be health boosts or something.
